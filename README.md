# About Me

I'm an incoming undergraduate studying **Physics and Philosophy**. Iâ€™m interested in data science and quantum computing. More broadly, I am exploring the intersections between physics and computer science.

## Projects

- **mwnesweeper**: A Minesweeper game created using Python and tkinter for A-level computer science coursework with a board solver
- **Planet-hunting-local**: A collaborative project using Kepler satellite data to display findings using matplotlib
- **QuantumLearning**: Not a project, but my learning files for Microsoft Learn's _Introduction to Quantum Computing_ and Microsoft katas learn. In the future, I want to supplement it with IBM Skillsbuild's Qiskit course.

## Skills (developing)

- Python, SQL, Tableau
- Numpy, matplotlib
- Markdown, LaTeX
- Basic Q#, Qiskit
- Git
